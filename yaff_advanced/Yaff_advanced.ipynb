    "This notebook is devoted to performing advanced molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in *Yaff*. As explained in the previous notebook, the general idea of MD simulations is to sample the molecular phase space in a smart way, by sampling those regions with high boltzmann probability. For the details of regular MD simulations, we refer to the previous notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the success of regular MD simulations, their usage can be limited for real-life systems. Often, the phase space of these real-life systems contains enery barriers which can not be overcome during a regular MD simulation. Hence, several enhanced sampling methods were proposed to overcome this issue. Some advanced sampling methods exploit the constraints forced by the employed ensemble, such as **thermodynamic integration** in the $(N, V, \\sigma_a = {\\bf 0}, T)$ ensemble, wheras others use an additional bias potential, *i.e.* **umbrella sampling** and **metadynamics**. Herein, we explain how to these biased simulations can be performed in *Yaff*, and illustrate the importance of choosing good **collective variables**.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The system under study: Cyclohexane\n",
    "2. The importance of collective variables\n",
    "3. Metadynamics\n",
    "4. Umbrella sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these advanced simulations use additional *Python* modules, contained in `colvar.py` (for the collective variables), `DMTD.py` (for metadynamics), and `DUS.py` (for umbrella sampling). These *Python* packages are not yet avaialble in the newest *Yaff* release, but are provided in this folder."

Upon convergence, we hence find the free energy profile $F(q)$ as the negative of the bias potential: $F(q)=-U_b(q)$.
