Unit tests are often designed to test a broad range of the expected functionality, including any weird corner cases and some tests that should not work. They tend to interact minimally with external resources like the disk, the network, and databases; testing code that accesses these resources is usually put under functional tests, regression tests, or integration tests. A detailed explanation on how to start using **nosetests** for unit testing can be found [here](http://ivory.idyll.org/articles/nose-intro.html). Note that, while these unit tests are typically defined on a small part of the code, the complete set of unit tests should completely cover the software. Without a **complete coverage**, these unit tests give no guarantee whatever that your code will work."
