Of course, feel free to skip those topics that are too easy, and concentrate on the harder ones (or the challenges at the end of each notebook).\n",

    "4. NumPy and Matplotlib\n",

During your master dissertation, your *Python* scripts will most likely be written in a text editor such as *gedit* or *nano*, and executed in the terminal window using the command `python script.py`. Everything that the script outputs, which would normally appear in your terminal window, will here appear below the box you just executed. See for yourself in the chunk of code below:"
