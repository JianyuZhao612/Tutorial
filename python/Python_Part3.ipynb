Second, define a function `grades_average` that takes in a list of grades and returns the average of these grades, using your previous function. (There is actually a built-in function to sum over all items in a list: `sum(grades)` will simply work.)\n",
    "4. On to the next statistic: the variance. The variance allows us to see how widespread the grades are from the average. Define a new function called `grades_variance` that accepts one argument: a list of scores. In the body of this function, determine the squared deviation of each score from the average of the list: `(average-score)**2`. Sum these contributions, and divide by the total number of scores to obtain the variance. Return this variance.\n",
    "5. Write a function called `grades_std` that accepts one argument, a list of scores, and returns the standard deviation of these scores. The standard deviation is defined as the square root of the variance.\n",
    "6. Finally, calculate the average, variance and standard deviation of the `grades` list to verify your functions. When rounded to two decimal figures, you should obtain 80.42, 334.07, and 18.28 for the average, variance, and standard deviation, respectively."

    "In this last project, you will build a simplified, one-player version of the classic board game *Battleship*. In this version of the game, there will be a single ship hidden in a random location on a 5x5 grid. The player will have 4 guesses to try to sink the ship."

    "1. Create a variable `board`, an empty list. Create a 5x5 grid initialized to all `\"O\"`s and store it in `board`. Use the `range` function to iterate over the five rows, and recall the `[\"A\"]*5` syntax.\n",
    "2. Now that we've built our board, let's show it off. Throughout the game, we'll want to print the game board so that the player can see which locations they have already guessed. Regularly printing the board will also help us debug our program, but the default `print` statement does a poor job to give a nice overview of the board (you can check this if you want). Hence, we will define a function `print_board` with a single argument, `board`. Inside the function, write a `for` loop to iterate through each row in the board. For each row, use the `separator.join(list)` method to join the elements of each row together, using `\" \"` as the separator, and print it to the screen. Call your function with `board` to make sure that it works.\n",
    "3. Let's now hide the battleship in a random location on the board. Since we have a two-dimensional list, we'll use two variables to store the ship's location: `ship_row` and `ship_col`.\n",
    "    1. First, import the function `randint` from the module `random`. The function `randint` can be called as `randint(low,high)` to give a random integer in the range [`low`,`high`[.\n",
    "    2. Define a new function, `random_row`, that takes a board as input. This function should return a random row index from your board. As we only use square boards in this challenge, you can also use this function to draw a random column index.\n",
    "    3. Store the random row and column indices in the variables `ship_row` and `ship_col`.\n",
    "4. Now that you've hidden your battleship in the ocean, let's write a function, `player_guess`, to allow the player to guess where it is. This function takes as arguments the `board` in its current state, as well as `ship_row` and `ship_col`. The function should do the following:\n",
    "    1. Ask the player to provide a guess for the row and column (in separate statements), and store these variables (recall the `input` function).\n",
    "    2. If the guess is correct, the function should print out `\"Congratulations! You sank my battleship!\"`.\n",
    "    3. If the guess is incorrect, three possibilities may occur. If the guessed row and/or column fall outside the range of the board, print out `\"Oops, that's not even in the ocean.\"`. If the guessed location was guessed before, print `\"You've guessed that one already\"`. For all other incorrect guesses, print the statement `\"You missed my battleship!\"`, and mark on the `board` the guessed location by an `\"X\"`.\n",
    "    4. In any case, return the `board` in its new state, as well as a boolean indicating whether your battleship has been sunk.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. Add a `for` loop that repeats the guessing and checking for four turns. It should print at the beginning of each iteration the number of the iteration (starting from 1), and the current state of the board. Depending on whether the player succeeds in finding your battleship within the allocated number of guesses, the following should happen:\n",
    "    1. If the player guesses incorrectly at the last turn, print `\"Game over.\"`\n",
    "    2. If the player guesses correctly, the game should end.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. Have fun! You can increase the number of guesses, if it's too hard, or implement larger boards and more (bigger) ships. Check whether your program correctly identifies all possible wrong guesses."
